## 1 Linear model: Drowing data with Stan

```{r}
data("drowning")
```

### a) Find the three mistakes

Below I marked the three errors within the Stan script.

```{r}
writeLines(readLines("listing1.stan"))
```

### b)

I chose $\beta \sim N(0, \sigma_{beta} = 25)$ since I show below that $Pr(-69 < \beta < 69)$ is alittle above .99.

```{r}
integrate(function(beta) {dnorm (beta, 0, 25)}, -69, 69)
```

### c)

Below I show how I added the priors, before the likelihood function. Notice that in my Stan script, I already have the priors added.

`
// Priors
beta ~ normal(0, 25);
alpha ~ normal(1980+143, 28)
`

### d)

Because I have no information about the constant (e.g., what the value of drownings was when Jesus was borned), then I rather just keep it as uniform.


### Extra:

I show if I obtain similar figures to those in the assignment.

```{r}
# Creating the data
data <- list(N = length(drowning$year),
             x = drowning$year,
             y = drowning$drownings,
             xpred = 2020)
fit <- stan(file = 'listing1.stan', data = data, verbose = FALSE)
extracted <- extract(fit)
```

Below I show the histogram for beta:

```{r}
hist(extracted$beta, breaks = 100)
```

Below I show the histogram for the value in 2020:

```{r}
hist(extracted$ypred, breaks = 100)
```

## 2 Hierarchical model: factory data with Stan

```{r}
data("factory")
ypool <- matrix(as.matrix(factory), ncol = 1)
ypool <- as.vector(ypool) # previous dimensions were 30x1, but Stan expects 30 ... do not know the difference but meh! computers.
stan_data <- list(
  y = factory,        # Data in 5x6 dimension
  N = nrow(factory),  # Number of observations per machine
  J = ncol(factory),  # Number of machines
  ypool = ypool
)
test <- stan(file = 'test.stan', data = stan_data)
print(test)
testExtracted <- extract(test)
```

### a) Description of models:

- Separate model

Our machine observations are assumed to come from

$y_{ij} \sim N(\mu_j,\sigma_j)$

where the prior distribution of the parameters are

$\mu_j \sim N(0,1)$

$\sigma_j \sim N(0,1)$

Notice here that what is happening is that the modelling discerns between observations as they come from different machines.

- Pooled model

Our machine observations are assumed to come from a common *pooled* distribution as defined by

$y_{i} \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$

where in addition, the prior distribution of the parameters are

$\mu \sim N(0,1)$

$\sigma \sim N(0,1)$

Notice here that what is happening is that the modelling does not discern between observations as they come from different machines; they are pooled together.

- Hierarchical model

Our machine observations are assumed to come from

$y_{ij} \sim N(\mu_j,\sigma)$

where in addition, the prior distribution of the parameters are

$\mu_j \sim N(0,\tau)$

where $\tau~N(0,1)$ is our *hyper-parameters*. The distribution of the shape parameter is drawn as:

$\sigma \sim N(0,1)$

Notice that here, we are restricting our parameters of location $mu_j$ to be drawn from a common distribution whose parameter of location is, in turn, drawn from another normal distribution, a weekly *hyper-prior*: $\tau \sim N(0,10)$

### b) Stan scripts for each model

- Pooled model:

```{r}
pooled <- stan(file = 'pooled.stan', data = stan_data, verbose = FALSE)
#print(pooled)
pooledExtracted <- extract(pooled)
writeLines(readLines("pooled.stan"))
```

- separate model:

```{r}
separate <- stan(file = 'separate.stan', data = stan_data, verbose = FALSE)
#print(separate)
separateExtracted <- extract(separate)
writeLines(readLines("separate.stan"))
```

- Hierarchical model

```{r}
hierarchical <- stan(file = 'hierarchical.stan', data = stan_data, verbose = FALSE)
#print(hierarchical)
hierarchicalExtracted <- extract(hierarchical)
writeLines(readLines("hierarchical.stan"))
```

### c)

- **the posterior distribution of the mean of the quality measurements of the sixth machine**

  - separate:
  


- the predictive distribution for another quality measurements of the sixth machine

- the posterior distrubtion of the mean of the quality of the seventh machine.


### d)

First, we create the function to report the mean with the 90% true intervals:

```{r}
estIntervals <- function(sims) {
  
  est <- mean(sims)
  low <- quantile(sims, .05)
  upp <- quantile(sims, .95)
  
  value <- list(
    est = est,
    low = low,
    upp = upp
  )
  
  return(value)
}
```


- Pooled model:

```{r}
pooledv2 <- stan(file = 'pooledv2.stan', data = stan_data, verbose = FALSE)
print(pooledv2)
pooledv2Extracted <- extract(pooledv2)

estIntervals(pooledv2Extracted$mu)
```

- separate model:

```{r}
separatev2 <- stan(file = 'separatev2.stan', data = stan_data, verbose = FALSE)
print(separatev2)
separatev2Extracted <- extract(separatev2)

estIntervals(separatev2Extracted$mu[1])
```

- Hierarchical model

```{r}
hierarchicalv2 <- stan(file = 'hierarchicalv2.stan', data = stan_data, verbose = FALSE)
print(hierarchical)
hierarchicalv2Extracted <- extract(hierarchicalv2)

estIntervals(hierarchicalv2Extracted$mu[1])
```
